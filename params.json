When executed this program will create a backup of the original project and create a new project that can be used with Gradle and Android Studio.\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n1. Download the jar from [here](http://google.com).\r\n2. Open a command prompt window and execute as follows:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\njava -jar apc.jar \"C:/Path/to/original/project\" \"C:/Path/to/converted/project\" \"Name\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example: The following command would convert a project called MyCoolApp.\r\n```shell\r\njava -jar apc.jar \"C:/android/MyCoolApp\" \"C:/android/MyCoolAppProject\" MyCoolApp\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Contributing\r\nThis is a maven project, built with Maven 2.2.1\r\nOnce the source is downloaded, execute the following from the root directoy:\r\n```shell\r\nmvn clean verify\r\n```\r\nThis will run all tests and pull all dependencies required.\r\n\r\n##Roadmap\r\n1. Implement a feature to check for updates to the `apc.jar` file.\r\n2. Provide another option to specify an Android Test Project and move the contents appropriately to the gradle project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
